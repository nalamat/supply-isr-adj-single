Integrated switching adjustable single power supply based on TI TPS54232


## Application notes
Input voltage range: 3.5 to 28v  
Output voltage range: 0.8 to 25v in steps of 0.1v  
Maximum output current: 2A  
Normally off, turns on by shorting EN pin header to On  
Output is also adjustable using shorting jumpers on Vadj pin header
